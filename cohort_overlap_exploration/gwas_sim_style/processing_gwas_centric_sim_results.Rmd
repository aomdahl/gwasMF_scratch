Look at the spearmen correlation one...

```{r}
dir <- "/scratch16/abattle4/ashton/snp_networks/scratch/cohort_overlap_exploration/gwas_sim_style/null_matrix_spearman/"
sim.results <- list.files(dir, pattern = "*res.csv")
all.results <- do.call("rbind", lapply(sim.results, function(x) fread(paste0(dir,x)) %>% mutate("sim_num" = gsub(pattern="res.csv", replacement = "",x = x))))
length(unique(all.results$sim_num))
```
Note- all 50 ran, although with varying things.
Simple plot- how does rho^2 change with overlap?
**GLOBAL**
```{r}
ggplot(all.results, aes(x = overlap, y= rho^2 )) + geom_jitter()
ggplot(all.results, aes(x = as.factor(round(overlap*100/15000, digits = 2)), y= rho^2 )) + geom_violin() + theme_classic(15) + xlab("Percent sample overlap in GWAS ") + ylab("Squared Spearman Rank Correlation")  + ggtitle("All latent factors increasingly correspond to\ncohort structure as sample overlap increases")

ggplot(all.results, aes(x = as.factor(round(overlap*100/15000, digits = 2)), y = rho^2, fill = pc)) + geom_violin() + theme_classic(15) + xlab("Percent sample overlap in GWAS ") + ylab("Squared Spearman Rank Correlation")  + ggtitle("All latent factors increasingly correspond to\ncohort structure as sample overlap increases")

ggplot(all.results, aes(x = as.factor(round(overlap*100/15000, digits = 2)), y= rho^2 )) + geom_boxplot() + theme_classic(15) + xlab("Percent sample overlap in GWAS ") + ylab("Squared Spearman Rank Correlation") + ggtitle("All latent factors increasingly correspond to\ncohort structure as sample overlap increases")
```
**PC-specific**
```{r}
ggplot(all.results, aes(x = as.factor(round(overlap*100/15000, digits = 2)), y= rho^2,fill = as.factor(pc) )) + geom_boxplot() + theme_classic(15) + xlab("Percent sample overlap in GWAS ") + ylab("Squared Spearman Rank Correlation") + ggtitle("Top latent factors increasingly correspond to\ncohort structure as sample overlap increases") + labs(fill = "Singular\nVector") + scale_fill_manual(values=natparks.pals("Yellowstone", 4))

ggplot(all.results, aes(x = as.factor(round(overlap*100/15000, digits = 2)), y= -log10(p),fill = as.factor(pc) )) + geom_boxplot() + theme_classic(15) + xlab("Percent sample overlap in GWAS ") + ylab("-log10(p) of Spearman correlation") + geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05), color = "red") +  ggtitle("Top latent factors increasingly correspond to\ncohort structure as sample overlap increases") + labs(fill = "Singular\nVector") + scale_fill_manual(values=natparks.pals("Yellowstone", 4)) + 
  annotate(geom="text", x = 6.3, y = -log10(0.04), label = "p = 0.05", color = "red")
```

**Reconstruction of "original"**
We treat the inital one as the "true" F and L
PAUSE on this- didn't run correctly, only did partial. Okay though.
```{r}
source("/scratch16/abattle4/ashton/snp_networks/gwas_decomp_ldsc/src/plot_functions.R")
dir.null <- "/scratch16/abattle4/ashton/snp_networks/scratch/cohort_overlap_exploration/gwas_sim_style/null_matrix_spearman/"
loadings.n <- list.files(dir.null, pattern = "*u.csv")
factors.n <- list.files(dir.null, pattern = "v.csv")
pve.n <- list.files(dir.null, pattern = "pve.c")
plotFactorsBarplot(fread(paste0(dir.null, factors.n[1])), trait_names = paste0("F",1:6), title ="none")
plot(scan(paste0(dir.null, pve.n[1]), what = character()))
```
```{r}
null.loadings <- lapply(loadings.n, function(x) fread(paste0(dir.null,x)) %>% mutate("sim_id" = gsub(pattern=".u.csv", replacement = "",x = x)) %>% tidyr::separate(sim_id, into=c("sim_num", "overlap"), sep = "\\.", remove = TRUE))

null.pve <- do.call("rbind", lapply(pve.n, function(x) fread(paste0(dir.null,x)) %>% mutate("sim_id" = gsub(pattern=".pve.csv", replacement = "",x = x)) %>% tidyr::separate(sim_id, into=c("sim_num", "overlap"), sep = "\\.", remove = TRUE) %>% mutate("pc"=1:6))) %>% mutate("perc_overlap" = round(as.numeric(overlap)/15000, digits = 3))

```
How does PVE change?

```{r}

ggplot(null.pve, aes(x = as.factor(perc_overlap), y=pve )) + geom_boxplot() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE, color="blue", aes(group="1")) + facet_wrap(~pc,scales = "free_y" ) + theme_classic(15) + xlab("Percent overlap") + ylab("PVE")
```
Which factors are "significant"?
```{r}
sig <- 1/6
by.sig <- null.pve %>% filter(pve >= sig)
  all.pve %>% filter(pve >= sig) %>% mutate("jid" = paste0(overlap, ":", pc)) %>% group_by(jid) %>% summarize("num" = n()) %>% print()

```


Let's look at factor reconstruction.....
Does this make sense in the null setting, when there shouldn't be any "real" signal?

```{r}

```



### 8/23....
#Non-null version
But that is exactly what we can do with the non-null version...
Recall- 3 european populations (all same MAFs), generate 3 GWAS from each one (same 3 traits here- same distributions, same SNPs). Traits 1 and 2 are indepepndent, one is polygenic, one is oligogenic, and 3 is a sum of the first 2 (no true genetic effects.)
```{r}
dir <- "/scratch16/abattle4/ashton/snp_networks/scratch/cohort_overlap_exploration/gwas_sim_style/non_null_matrix/"
loadings <- list.files(dir, pattern = "*u.csv")
factors <- list.files(dir, pattern = "v.csv")
pve <- list.files(dir, pattern = "pve.c")

all.loadings <- lapply(loadings, function(x) fread(paste0(dir,x)) %>% mutate("sim_id" = gsub(pattern=".u.csv", replacement = "",x = x)) %>% tidyr::separate(sim_id, into=c("sim_num", "overlap"), sep = "\\.", remove = TRUE))
cohort_overlap <- c(1,1000,5000,7500,10000,12500)
```
To assess this here, what I would like to do:
1) How well do high-overlap PCs recaptiulate the "true" PC? How much do they diverge over time?
  (do both the BEST match, as well as the ordered match)
2) How closely do the factors correspond to the trait assignment?

Need to calibrate: how many factors to include? My initial intuition is 3, but it seems like actually looking at these factors suggests something else.
What I should do is look at PVE > 1/9, but I don't have that data for these runs. So looks like its re-run time.
Let's also get a practical look.
```{r}
source("/scratch16/abattle4/ashton/snp_networks/gwas_decomp_ldsc/src/plot_functions.R")
full.tab <- NULL
for(i in c(1,5,10,15,20,25,30))
{
  for(c in cohort_overlap)
  {
    if(c == 1)
    {
      loadings.og <- fread(paste0(dir,i,".",c,".u.csv"))
      factors.og <-  fread(paste0(dir,i,".",c,".v.csv"))
      print(plotFactorsBarplot(as.matrix(factors.og[,1:3]),trait_names = c("A1", "B1", "C1","A2", "B2", "C2","A3", "B3", "C3" ), title = "Putative true factors",
                   cluster = FALSE, colors = c("A", "B", "C","A", "B", "C","A", "B", "C")) + labs(fill = "Trait") + scale_fill_manual(values=natparks.pals("Yellowstone", 3)))
    } 

  }
}

```
Based on these, its pretty clear that just 2 factors make sense

```{r}
source("/scratch16/abattle4/ashton/snp_networks/scratch/cohort_overlap_exploration/src/evaluateSimR2.R")
source("/scratch16/abattle4/ashton/snp_networks/gwas_decomp_ldsc/src/plot_functions.R")
full.tab <- NULL
for(i in 1:50)
{
  for(c in cohort_overlap)
  {
    if(c == 1)
    {
      loadings.og <- fread(paste0(dir,i,".",c,".u.csv"))
      factors.og <-  fread(paste0(dir,i,".",c,".v.csv"))
    } else
    {
      loadings.curr <- fread(paste0(dir,i,".",c,".u.csv"))
      factors.curr <-  fread(paste0(dir,i,".",c,".v.csv"))
      max.r2 <- evaluteFactorConstruction(as.matrix(loadings.og[,1:2]), as.matrix(factors.og[,1:2]), as.matrix(loadings.curr[,1:2]), as.matrix(factors.curr[,1:2]))
      full.tab <- rbind(full.tab, c(i,c,max.r2))
    }
  }
}

plotFactors(as.matrix(factors.og[,1:2]),trait_names = c("A1", "B1", "C1","A2", "B2", "C2","A3", "B3", "C3" ), title = "Putative true factors")

plotFactorsBarplot(as.matrix(factors.og[,1:2]),trait_names = c("A1", "B1", "C1","A2", "B2", "C2","A3", "B3", "C3" ), title = "Putative true factors", cluster = FALSE, colors = c(natparks.pals("Yellowstone", 3),natparks.pals("Yellowstone", 3), natparks.pals("Yellowstone", 3))) + labs(fill = "Trait") + scale_fill_manual(values=natparks.pals("Yellowstone", 3))

full.tab <- data.frame(full.tab) %>% set_colnames(c("iter", "overlap", "loading_R2", "factor_R2")) %>% print()
```
PLot that ish...
```{r}
l <- ggplot(full.tab, aes(x = as.factor(round(overlap*100/15000, digits = 2)), y = loading_R2)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_classic(15) + 
  xlab("Percent cohort overlap") + ylab(bquote("Loading"~R^2))

f <- ggplot(full.tab, aes(x = as.factor(round(overlap*100/15000, digits = 2)), y = factor_R2)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_classic(15) + 
  xlab("Percent cohort overlap") + ylab(bquote("Factor"~R^2))
cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = list(l,f))
```

Want to try repeating with just the best sign orientation, no orientation with respect to order. This assumes the order is consistent.
being a little lazy about it though, not dealing with sign issue...
```{r}
quick.ordered.r2 <- function(og, curr)
{
      signs <- sign(cor(as.matrix(og[,1:2]), as.matrix(curr[,1:2])))
      cor(unlist(curr[,1:2]) * c(rep(signs[1,1], nrow(curr)),rep(signs[2,2], nrow(curr))), unlist(og[,1:2]))^2
}

full.tab.ordered <- NULL
for(i in 1:50)
{
  for(c in cohort_overlap)
  {
    if(c == 1)
    {
      loadings.og <- fread(paste0(dir,i,".",c,".u.csv"))
      factors.og <-  fread(paste0(dir,i,".",c,".v.csv"))
    } else
    {
      loadings.curr <- fread(paste0(dir,i,".",c,".u.csv"))
      factors.curr <-  fread(paste0(dir,i,".",c,".v.csv"))
      l <- quick.ordered.r2(loadings.og, loadings.curr)
      f <- quick.ordered.r2(factors.og, factors.curr)
      full.tab.ordered <- rbind(full.tab.ordered, c(i,c,l,f))
    }
  }
}
full.tab.ordered <- data.frame(full.tab.ordered) %>% set_colnames(c("iter", "overlap", "loading_R2", "factor_R2")) %>% print()

```
PLot it. Should be no better than the previous:
```{r}
l <- ggplot(full.tab.ordered, aes(x = as.factor(round(overlap*100/15000, digits = 2)), y = loading_R2)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_classic(15) + 
  xlab("Percent cohort overlap") + ylab(bquote("Loading"~R^2))

f <- ggplot(full.tab.ordered, aes(x = as.factor(round(overlap*100/15000, digits = 2)), y = factor_R2)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_classic(15) + 
  xlab("Percent cohort overlap") + ylab(bquote("Factor"~R^2))
cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = list(l,f))
```

Thinking time.
I suspect that the issue will not necessarily be in the 1st 2 effects, but on detecting spurious other "significant" effects.
So the problem boils down not to detecing spurious effects, but how many "significant" factors will be detected.
Hypothesis: Higher cohort overlap will manifest itself as spurious factors.
This introduces an interesting problem: how do we prune those out? At what point do we designate a factor as "significant" or not?
Maybe we need to do something like they do in Burren et al, which is...???
Task: rerun with PVE data.
# 8/25
I now have the PVE data. Let's see what we can do.
Simplest test: how does the distribution of PVE shift over time?
```{r}
all.pve <- do.call("rbind", lapply(pve, function(x) fread(paste0(dir,x)) %>% mutate("sim_id" = gsub(pattern=".pve.csv", replacement = "",x = x)) %>% tidyr::separate(sim_id, into=c("sim_num", "overlap"), sep = "\\.", remove = TRUE) %>% mutate("pc"=1:9))) %>% mutate("perc_overlap" = round(as.numeric(overlap)/15000, digits = 3))
head(all.pve)
```
Take a look
```{r}
ggplot(all.pve %>% filter(pc==1), aes(x = as.factor(overlap), y=pve )) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(all.pve %>% filter(pc==2), aes(x = as.factor(overlap), y=pve )) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(all.pve %>% filter(pc==3), aes(x = as.factor(overlap), y=pve )) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(all.pve, aes(x = as.factor(perc_overlap), y=pve )) + geom_boxplot() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE, color="blue", aes(group="1")) + facet_wrap(~pc,scales = "free_y" ) + theme_classic(15) + xlab("Percent overlap") + ylab("PVE")
```
There does not appear to be a major trend in the PVE explained by each factor as it goes up.
Looking at a significance test... classic one
Question- do we get more significant factors when we have higher overlap, or not?
Maybe I should be looking at this in the null case, huh.
```{r}
sig <- 1/9
by.sig <- all.pve %>% filter(pve >= sig)
  all.pve %>% filter(pve >= sig) %>% mutate("jid" = paste0(overlap, ":", pc)) %>% group_by(jid) %>% summarize("num" = n())

```
Well, it looks like my hypothesis was wrong.
And it also looks like 2 is good enough the entire time.
So case closed on this issue.

More complex- use this to limit how many samples to include in the tests above...
